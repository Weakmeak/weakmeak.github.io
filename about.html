        <h3>What's Up? My Name's Caleb.</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a dynamic digital generalist with a rich and varied background that spans the worlds of both game development and performance. 
            As a former radio DJ turned aspiring software and game developer, I am about to graduate with a degree in Software and Game Development. 
            My journey through the digital landscape has equipped me with a broad skill set that includes programming, voice acting, broadcasting, sound design, 
            visual arts, 3D rendering, writing, music composition, and game design. 
            This diverse experience allows me to approach projects with a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise.
        </p>

            While I may not have deep specialization in one particular field, my strength lies in my ability to integrate various disciplines seamlessly. 
            Whether I'm designing an immersive game world, creating captivating audio experiences, or contributing to a compelling narrative, my goal is to bring innovative and engaging ideas to life. 
            I'm excited to explore new opportunities where I can leverage my multifaceted background to make a meaningful impact.
